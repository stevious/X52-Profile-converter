# X52-Profile-converter

### Tools to convert between X52 and X52 Pro profiles.

To use, simply run the appropriate .exe / .py file, use the file browser to select a .pr0 profile file to convert, and click the **convert** button.
The new .pr0 file compatible with the target joystick type will be created in the same directory with an updated suffix.

Note that the .pr0 filename should not contain letters, e.g. "DCS_F15C.pr0", as this will cause driver issues making the stick disconnect and re-calibrate mid-use.
To avoid problems just make sure to remove any numbers from the filename, so e.g. "DCS_Fftn.pr0.
